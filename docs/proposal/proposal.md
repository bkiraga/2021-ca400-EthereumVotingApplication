### **Introduction**

Our proposed project is a web-app voting platform built with blockchain technology to provide a secure, decentralised and incorruptible platform for voting. We intend for our application to be used in national political elections across the globe.


### **Outline**

The web application will consist of:

*   A blockchain ledger shared with all users
*   A registration system
*   An authentication system
*   A voting system
*   A fully accessible web application which incorporates all of the above features


### **Background**

The inspiration for this project originated from our interest in blockchain technology and its numerous practical applications. We realised that a voting application is a great, practical idea that allows us to learn more about blockchain and showcase some of its advantages in a relevant, real world context.


### **Achievements**

Our project aims to eliminate the possibility of corruption or election tampering within democracies and allows for a secure means of remotely voting. Users would be the voters of a nation using this technology.

We aim to make the technology fully accessible to the visually impaired and or hearing impaired individuals to ensure their voices are heard.


### **Justification**

The current political climate could greatly benefit from a secure decentralised voting. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic means that there is an increased demand for ways to vote remotely and the number of people worldwide with access to the internet is increasing at a rapid rate, even in the developing countries where the issue of political corruption is more apparent. 

There has been a lot of controversy during elections in countries such as Belarus, Russia and Venezuela and we believe that the use of decentralized blockchain based voting systems in such places could provide more transparency and fairer results if it were to be implemented.
